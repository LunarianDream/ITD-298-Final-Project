                    <div>
                        <p>
                          My genuine honest opinions is that the course wasn't hard enough, and there should have been focused on something other than Dreamweaver as no one really uses it these days
                      </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>
                              I enjoyed my time here at Reynolds. The professors were all easy to communicate with and very helpful when asked. The staff have also been really nice. I do wish the Web Design program gave more coding challenges, for example making us code design mockups.
                          </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>
                              I feel very confident about getting a job eventually, though probably not immediately. There's still a lot to learn that the program doesn't cover, but I feel that if one practices and learns outside of the program they will have an easier time, which is something I've done.

                        <p>
                        I thought this course was very insightfu Before this course i had never thought about websites and how they were built. So, i would have to say that i learned a lot from this course alone.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                            <p>
                            I personally have only taken one class in the web development program. I would have to say based one course alone that it was very well done for someone that has only taken one class and I felt that the professor was very engaging and hands on with the students.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                            For now I am going to contine my sutdies in Information Systestem Technology and cyber security. I dont think that i have enough classes and knowledge based around web development to try for a career in the industry.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>
                          I thought that the course was okay, It wasn't hard but it was a little bit time-consuming, and I also think that even though Dreamweaver is an excellent platform to code on, it was confusing at times considering we were using different versions.

                            <p>
                              I will probably use my knowledge of code to create websites for myself and other small businesses. I feel like I can get a job in web development, but I will definitely need to learn more about coding before even considering getting a job.
